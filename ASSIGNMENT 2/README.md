# 💡 Reflection
After listening to the talk by PPG, I learned about the importance of the Data Analytics CoE, SAP CoE and Global Infrastructure CoE in a Digital IT organization. For example, Data Analytics CoE can make business operations more efficient and minimize the risks within an organization.

Besides that, I also learned about the essential skills needed before entering the industry and the possible career paths available. For example, in order to join a data analytics team, we need to be familiar with programming languages such as SQL and data visualization software.

Moreover, they also explained the difference between academic exercises and industry reality. I realized that I need to explore more knowledge instead of following the existing academic syllabus to make sure I have the ability to handle complicated industry work.

Before they ended the talk, they also promoted the internship program they provided. If we join the PPG internship program, we can work with different business functions and different projects to gain cross-functional experience. Besides that, interns in PPG will be considered for full-time employment at the end of the internship.
