# 💡 Reflection

After listening to the talk, I learned about the importance of the Data Analytics CoE, SAP CoE and Global Infrastructure CoE in a Digital IT organization. For example, Data Analytics CoE can make business operations more efficient and minimize the risks within an organization.

Besides that, I also learned about the essential skills needed before entering the industry and the possible career paths available. For example, in order to join a data analytics team, we need to be familiar with programming languages such as SQL and data visualization software.
