# 💡 Reflection
After the PC assembly session, I learned about the PC assembly and disassembly process, including the functions of different cables and how to connect them to ensure the PC can function properly. 

The session allowed students to have hands-on practice in assembling and disassembling a PC. Therefore, students can develop practical skills in assembling and disassembling their own PCs in the future.
