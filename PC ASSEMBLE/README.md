# 💡 Reflection
After the PC assembly session, I learned about the PC assembly and disassembly process. The technicians also explained to us the components of a PC, including the functions of different cables and how to connect them to ensure the PC can function properly. Not only that, they also explained to us the precautions on handling those components to avoid damaging them.

The session allowed students to have hands-on practice in assembling and disassembling a PC. Therefore, students can develop practical skills in using different tools when assembling and disassembling their own PCs in the future.
