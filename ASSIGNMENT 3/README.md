# 💡 Reflection
After listening to Industry Talk 2, I learned about project management and system development theories. I can now identify the differences between Waterfall and Agile development methodologies and apply them based on the specific requirements of a project.

Besides that, I also gained insights and valuable experience from the speaker’s success. I realized that as a student, in order to improve my abilities and employability, I need to explore and study the latest technologies beyond the academic syllabus.
