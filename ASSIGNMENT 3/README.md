# 💡 Reflection
After listening to Industry Talk 2, I learned about project management and system development theories. I can now identify the differences between Waterfall and Agile development methodologies and apply them based on the specific requirements of a project. For example, the Waterfall methodology has clear milestones and is easy to manage, while Agile methodology is more flexible and allows faster feedback.

Besides that, I also gained insights and valuable experience from the speaker’s success. I realized that as a student, in order to improve my abilities and employability, I need to explore and study the latest technologies beyond the academic syllabus. For example, we need to know how to use AI wisely to increase our productivity without becoming too dependent on AI tools.
