# 💡 Reflection

## 📑 Poster 1
After listening to the talk by Clarity Techwork Sdn Bhd, I learned about the organisational structure of a complete organisation including management, HR and admin, various system developers and so on. Besides that, I also learned about the qualities that the ICT industry is looking for. For example, they prefer an employee who loves technology, is a self-learner and is a team-player.

After that, the employees from that company shared with us the different job scopes for different positions such as an Android developer and a UI/UX designer. They shared with us their daily routine and the technologies used, such as VS Code for coding and Jira for distributing tasks. I also learned about different skills required for different positions. The most common skills are analytical skills and creativity since these two skills are very important for every job in the ICT industry.

Besides that, they also shared their experiences about the differences between work, internship and student life. Moreover, they also gave us advice to improve ourselves before entering the ICT industry. For instance, we need to learn from our mistakes and avoid making the same mistakes in future work.

After listening to the talk by AirAsia, I learned that AirAsia had put a lot of effort and successfully made flying affordable for everyone. Besides that, AirAsia is the first airline that made flight booking available online in Southeast Asia. The speaker shared with us their products include not only airline services but also three different perspectives, which are "a-travel", "a-delivers" and "a-money". We can get all of these services from the AirAsia super-app.

After that, the manager of software engineering at AirAsia shared with us the culture in AirAsia. The "No Sir culture" is used between employees at AirAsia. They believe that all the AirAsia employees are essential and are known as "All Stars". Besides that, he also told us about the career paths in software engineering such as front-end developers and back-end developers, so that we can have a basic understanding and we can prepare for the career we prefer.

Lastly, the head of software engineering at AirAsia also shared his experience during the work from home (WFH) period. He debunked WFH myths, such as the idea that we need to dress up properly because most of the
communication requires us to turn on our cameras. Moreover, he also gave us WFH tips. For example,  we need to have a specific physical workspace to ensure that we can focus on our work. Furthermore, he also introduced the diversity in AirAsia and explained the importance of diversity.

Before the talk ended, I also gained a basic understanding of internship recruitment such as the minimum internship period at AirAsia, which is three months.
