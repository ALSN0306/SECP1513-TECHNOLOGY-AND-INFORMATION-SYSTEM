After listening to the talk by Clarity Techwork Sdn Bhd, I learned about the organisational structure of a complete organisation including management, HR and admin, various system developers and so on. Besides that, I also learned about the qualities that the ICT industry is looking for. For example, they prefer an employee who loves technology, is a self-learner and is a team-player.

After that, the employees from that company shared with us the different job scopes for different positions such as an Android developer and a UI/UX designer. They shared with us their daily routine and the technologies used, such as VS Code for coding and Jira for distributing tasks. I also learned about different skills required for different positions. The most common skills are analytical skills and creativity since these two skills are very important for every job in the ICT industry.

Besides that, they also shared their experiences about the differences between work, internship and student life. Moreover, they also gave us advice to improve ourselves before entering the ICT industry. For instance, we need to learn from our mistakes and avoid making the same mistakes in future work.
