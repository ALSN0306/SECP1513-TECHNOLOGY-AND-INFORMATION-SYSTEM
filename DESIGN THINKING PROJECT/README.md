# 💡 Reflection
\
After completing the design thinking project, I realised that design thinking is very important if we want to develop new products. The five stages of design thinking—empathy, define, ideate, prototype and test—outline the proper process we need to follow which includes collecting information, identifying existing problems, brainstorming solutions, implementing the solution and finally testing its functionality.

By learning design thinking skills, students are able to develop new projects using a proper process. This helps avoid confusion and chaos and the solutions can also address the problems effectively.
