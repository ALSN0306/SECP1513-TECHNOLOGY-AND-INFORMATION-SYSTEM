# 💡 Reflection
After completing the design thinking project, I realised that design thinking is very important if we want to develop new products. The five stages of design thinking—empathy, define, ideate, prototype and test—outline the proper process we need to follow which includes collecting information, identifying existing problems, brainstorming solutions, implementing the solution and finally testing its functionality. For example, in this project, we used Google Forms to collect information about existing problems in mental health facilities for UTM students. 

By learning design thinking skills, students are able to develop new projects using a proper process. This helps avoid confusion and chaos and the solutions can also address the problems effectively. For instance, after learning design thinking skills, we can provide a well-planned user interface which allows users to use it easily.
