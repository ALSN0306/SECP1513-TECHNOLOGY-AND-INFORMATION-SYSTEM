# 💡 Reflection
After visiting UTMDigital Open Days, I gained a clearer understanding of UTMDigital, including the various products and services they offer to all students and staff to make our daily tasks more efficient. For example, UTM Smart allows lecturers to take student attendance more easily rather than using traditional methods. Not only that, UTMDigital also provides all students and staff free WiFi (UTMWiFi) to make it easier for us to access the internet.

Besides that, I also learned about an online learning platform offered by Oracle, namely Oracle Academy. Oracle Academy provides students with free virtual learning resources. Therefore, students can gain hands-on experience with the latest technology to increase their employability. They also provide recommended pathways for several different topics. For example, if we are interested in Java, we can simply follow the Java pathway given by Oracle Academy.

Moreover, there are several booths from different companies. After visiting the booths, I learned about the technologies provided by those companies and the actual use of these technologies in the real world. For example, one of the booths I attended was MICROCORP. The staff showed me the Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS) which is software that helps companies manage their buildings, spaces, and maintenance in one system.
