# 💡 Reflection
After visiting UTMDigital Open Days, I gained a clearer understanding of UTMDigital, including the various products and services they offer to all students and staff to make our daily tasks more efficient. For example, UTM Smart allows lecturers to take student attendance more easily rather than traditional methods.

Besides that, I also learned about an online learning platform offered by Oracle, namely Oracle Academy. Oracle Academy provides students with free virtual learning resources. Therefore, students can gain hands-on experience with the latest technology to increase their employability.
